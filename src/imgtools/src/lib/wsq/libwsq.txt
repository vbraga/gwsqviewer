                library, but passing a precomputed DQT_TABLE

                into output WSQ buffer, by eliminating unneeded

                and NULL qdata) will decode original data.

                the decode.

                and won't reread the data.

                to wsq_crop_qdata and wsq_huffcode_mem. 
 read_wsq_frame_header - Parses WSQ memory until the frame header is
                found. The image dimensions and scale and shift
